# Hell Climb Racer

A fun little project I made with a friend! This repository contains only the parts I developed, as I only had access to my portion of the code.

## About the Game

A single-mission driving game inspired by Hill Climb Racing where you must collect coins before the other player collects them. 

### Features
- **Car Mechanics**: Physics-based vehicle handling
- **Fuel System**: Gas bar displayed on top - collect gas cans to refill it
- **Failure Conditions**: 
  - Lose if you hit the driver's head
  - Lose if you drive in both directions simultaneously
- **Two Playable Cars**: Both vehicles are fully functional in the final product
- **Easter Eggs**: Contains some funny references to my university

## Download & Play

**Fun Fact**: You lose if you try to go in both directions at once!
